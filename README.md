Database of Star Trek Fleet Command officers, ships, systems, hostiles, etc.

I started a project one weekend and never got around to finishing it.  I'm quitting the game now and don't think I ever will.  This database is not up to date, but should have everything up through July or August of 2020.  Feel free to use it however you wish.
